// The Windows API runs two parallel APIs. One which uses ANSI strings, and one which
// uses UNICODE strings. This means that a function in the Windows API actually has two versions.
// One which ends in *A and one which ends in W. A = ANSI and W = Wide (Unicode).
// Example: SetWindowTextA and SetWindowTextW.
// By defining the UNICODE macro, we can use the "pure" function name, i.e: SetWindowText, and our calls
// Will be redefined to the W version internally.
// MSDN recommends always using the Unicode version: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/working-with-strings
